Life is too short to live stock! Modifying Subarus is
one the best parts of owning a Subaru. The availability
of aftermarket options creates endless possibilities. Each
Subaru owner has their own taste and style. It's tough to 
know where to begin when modifying your Subaru. Below we've
created a list of recommended modications. We believe it's 
better to start small and work towards more advanced stuff later.

<h3 class="recommend">Our Recommendations</h3>

<ol>
<li class="modlist">Exhaust</li>

<div class="modspace">

</div>
<p class="modlist">
Price: $300-$2000+<br>
Hp/Tq Gains: 10-75Hp 5-50Tq<br>
This is a great place to start. Unleash the rumble with
a axle-back,<br> cat-back or turbo-back exhaust. Plenty of 
options to fit your budget.</p>

<li class="modlist">Intake</li>

<p class="modlist">
Price: $250-$450+<br>
Hp/Tq Gains: 10-35Hp 10-25Tq<br>
A cold air intake is must have for any Subaru owner. Subarus
are small motor turbocharged monsters. Turbochargers rely on 
air to boost the performance of the engine. An aftermarket CAI
(cold air intake) greatly increases airflow and decreases air 
temperature. This is an inexpensive way to get more out of your
Subaru!</p>

Tuning is a vital part of modifying a Subaru. We highly recommend
purchasing the Cobb Accessport. The accessport is a hand-held computer
capable of tuning your car anywhere. This unit comes preloaed with tune
maps from Cobb Tuning. Simple flash your Subaru and install a new tune
anytime. The process takes about five minutes to complete. Factory tunes
are restrictive and unexciting. Unleash the beast with the Cobb Accessport!
