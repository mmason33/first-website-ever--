<p class="paul">
The Subaru Fan Club was started in 2001 by one man: Paul Walker.
Today our membership is in the tens of thousands all over North
America.Paul Walker was the star of the world famous movie the 
The Fast and the Furious. This movies changed the car scene in
North America. In years prior, car clubs consisted of American made
muscle cars. Big motor Chevorlette, Ford, and Dodge car ruled the 
car industry. Fast and the Furious put the spotlight on small motor
foreign cars like Subaru, Honda, Acura, Mazada and Toyota. These cars
could achieve the same amount of power as the big motor cars. Foreign
small motor cars are significantly lighter than their American counterparts.
Lightweight, compact and delivering a huge amount of power these cars took
the racing world by storm.Paul Walker forever changed the car world.
